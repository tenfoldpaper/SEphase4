# 0. Previous phases #

a. Googletest implemented.
b. Large chunks of world, marker, bug classes implemented. (Read through the files for more details)
c. Part of the assembler was completed.

# 1. Assembler #

A simple cpp program that takes in a .buggy file and outputs a .bug file with correct code lines, as seen in the bugs.pdf and asm.pdf files. Currently, the input file has to be specified within the main.cpp file, and the output file will always be called final.bug . This will be fixed in the future. Since explaining it here will take a while, just try running it with the existing bug.buggy file and see the final.bug file to see what it does.

# 2. Instructions #

A series of .h and .cpp files starting with I\_. Used for parsing the final.bug file returned by the assembler and to build the bug brain. See code for more details.

# 3. Miscellaneous # 

Martial art functions have been added.
Program class has been added, and will be instantiated upon load (still testing) 
More Googletest files have been added.
The file system has been changed to make navigation a bit easier.
